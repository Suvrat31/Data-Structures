<h4>1.Singly Linked List (insertion at the tail)</h4>

## Searching Algorithms
1. [Linear Search](searching-algorithms/LinearSearch.java) - Time Complexity : O(n)
2. [Binary Search](searching-algorithms/BinarySearch.java) - Time Complexity : O(log(n))
3. [Jump Search](searching-algorithms/JumpSearch.java) - Time Complexity : O(sqrt(n))
4. [Exponential Search](searching-algorithms/ExponentialSearch.java) - Time Complexity : O(log(n)) 

## Sorting Algorithms
1. [Selection Sort](sorting-algorithms/SelectionSort.java) - Time Complexity : O(n^2)
2. [Bubble Sort](sorting-algorithms/BubbleSort.java) - Time Complexity : O(n^2)
3. [Recursive Bubble Sort](sorting-algorithms/RecursiveBubbleSort.java) - Time Complexity : O(n^2)

## Problems

| Problem     | Description | Time Complexity|
|  ---        |     ----    |          ---  |
| [Max Sum in a Contiguous Array](problems/maxSum.java)      | Find the contiguous subarray within an array, A of length N which has the largest sum       | O(n)   |
| [Implementing LRU Cache](problems/LRUCache.java)   | We are given total possible page numbers that can be referred. We are also given cache (or memory) size (Number of page frames that cache can hold at a time). The LRU caching scheme is to remove the least recently used frame when the cache is full and a new page is referenced which is not there in cache.        |       |
| [Largest Number](problems/LargestNumber.java)      | Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number       |    |
| [Palindrome Integer](problems/PalindromeInteger.java)      | Given an integer, find whether it is a palindrome or not saving maximum space possible or without using extra space      |    |
| [Noble Integer](problems/NobleInteger.java)      | Given an integer array A, find if an integer p exists in the array such that the number of integers greater than p in the array equals to p. Return 1 if any such integer p is found else return -1       | O(n^2)   |
| [Wave Array](problems/WaveArray.java)      | Given an array of integers, sort the array into a wave like array and return it,In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5.....       |    |
